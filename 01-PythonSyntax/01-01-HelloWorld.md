# 1.1 - Hello World

## The code

Inside a `.py` file, type the following code:

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

We will go through how the code works in a minute, but we'll first focus on running the code.

## Running the code

Open a terminal and use the `cd` command to go to your project folder. For example:

``` sh
cd ~/coding/my-project
```

Then, run the following command:

``` sh
python hello.py
```

(Replace `hello.py` with the name of your Python file).

## Output

If you did everything correctly, you should see the following output:

``` text
Hello, World!
```

Great! Now let's break down how the code actually works.

## How it works

Let's break down the following code:

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The `print` statement is a *function*. A function 'does something' based on the **input** we give it.

The brackets `()` contain the *arguments*. This is the data that the function takes in.

`"Hello, World!"` is a *string*. A string is basically just **text**.
